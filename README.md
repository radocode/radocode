### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I work as a Fullstack Developer, mainly focused in Javascript. I have experiences working with fintech, retail and transport industries.

- I enjoy a lot working and researching on new technologies, with small, simple, yet very effective solutions. My favorite frameworks/libraries/runtimes are Angular 2+ and React.js, but I also know Node.js and .NET (C#).

- I am passionate to help and guide people around with my current knowledge, and I am always willing to learn new things. I do a lot of research in order to share it later with everyone whenever I can. Always open to learn a new language or tech!

- I like to work under Agile methods and Scrum/Kanban teams as well.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Vue.js, Vuetify, NestJS and AWS Lambda stack for an insurance company.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, and all it's beauty. I am also learning a great deal of AWS Lambda!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Angular, or Typescript, don't be shy!
